Customer stated that there was an engine light, 4wd light and traction control lights on the dash, vehicle appeared to stick in 4th gear for a period of time but then came good after customer utilised sports shift mode. Diagnostic scan tool revealed that the torque converter clutch pressure control solenoid  was at fault, ""circuit getting stuck off"". Common causes for such fault is low oil in the transmission. We topped up transmission and vehicle seems to be working ok. We recommend removing old oil from transmission, flush transmission with flush, replace filter and add new oil.

Drained transmission fluid, remove pan, clean down internals and change out filter. Replace pan and top up with fluid. Took for road test, put back on hoist and drain fluid again. Top up fluid and get to operating temperature to check for accurate fluid level. Check with scan tool that no codes were showing. If problem persists, will require replacement of solenoid and further investigation.","",Patrick Bolt,72855d71-7afe-4265-9716-89a0dd759998,18/08/2023 10:52,,""
